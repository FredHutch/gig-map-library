## Genes-in-Genomes Map Library

Microbial genomes are incredibly diverse, and share groups of genes in complex and interesting
ways. To make these patterns a bit more comprehensible, we can create visual representations
which summarize which particular genes are found across a collection of genomes. This website
is used to host a collection of such maps.
